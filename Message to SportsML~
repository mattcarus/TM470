Hello, I'm an Open University student in the UK studying Computing and IT, and for my final year project I'm working with British Fencing to build a system to manage the results of fencing competitions (initially in the UK but there's no reason why it can't be used elsewhere too). I'd like to use SportsML-G2 to represent the data such that it can be easily exchanged. As SportsML-G2 doesn't support fencing, I'd like to write in that extra functionality to the standard and submit it for inclusion in the next version of the standard. I have the support of the Open University to do this, is it something that you'd consider adopting?
I look forward to hearing back from you.

Regards,
Matt Carus

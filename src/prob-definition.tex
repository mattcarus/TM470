\chapter{Problem Definition}

The sport of Fencing has a fairly small but loyal following in the UK.
As such, the support systems around the sport are not as developed as
they are in other sports. The National Governing Body of Fencing in the
UK, British Fencing, host the results of fencing competitions on their
website. The results are represented as static HTML files and there is
no way to present the data other than as a list of the results of each
competition (i.e. you can't view all of the results of a particular fencer).

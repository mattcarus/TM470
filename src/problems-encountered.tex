\section{Tomcat Garbage Collection} \label{section:tomcatGarbageCollection}
I found out that if an application is re-deployed to Tomcat (for example after
making some changes during development) the existing class instances remain in
the Java 'PermGen' memory and are not garbage-collegted as you might expect.
Over time this memory space will fill up and eventually a
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError exception will be thrown. This had me confused for a
while but after a bit of Googling I found that the easiest solution is simply to
restart Tomcat. It is possible to increase the PermGen space however this will
only delay the problem.
\section{XML Element Ordering} \label{section:xmlElementOrdering}
The SportsML schema dictates that elements be ordered correctly - Jersey doesn't
(and indeed can't) guarentee the order in which elements are rendered. To get
around this it's possible to define the order by using the
\(@XmlType\{propOrder=\{\ldots\}\}\) structure.

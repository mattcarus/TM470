I would like to acknowledge the assistance of the many people that have helped
me with this project, inluding my tutor Prof Peter Smith, Katie Rhodes from
British Fencing, members of the SportsML Yahoo
mailing list and, most of all my long-suffering wife Abby and our dog Dotty -
I'll start paying a bit more attention to you both again now!
